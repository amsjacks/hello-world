# hello-world
This repo is a grab-bag of odds and ends.

I'm a first-year BCS student at UBC in Vancouver, BC. (That's a compressed second degree program in CS.) My background is in law and linguistics, and I remain a huge language nerd. I have some experience programming in Java and am trying to make the  jump to learning a second programming language: python. 

Nice to meet you!
